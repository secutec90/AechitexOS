# Automation strategy — decide whether, where, and how before anyone builds

This is the discipline layer of the automation suite. It answers three questions that come *before* the first node is wired: **should this be automated at all?**, **on what platform, and is a platform even the right tool vs code?**, and **what orchestration guarantees does every automation have to meet so the fleet doesn't rot?** No platform API, no importable JSON, no code lives here — the moment the decision is made, you route to the skill that builds it.

Building the flow (design + importable artifact) → `../automation-flows/SKILL.md`. Driving a specific platform's live API/MCP → `../n8n/SKILL.md`, `../make/SKILL.md`, `../zapier/SKILL.md`, `../power-automate/SKILL.md`. A typed API client in code → `../api-connector-builder/SKILL.md`. Receiving webhooks in your own app → `../webhooks/SKILL.md`.

Every fact about pricing and platform capability below moves fast. Treat the `≈` figures as hedges and re-check the vendor page at author time; the honest limits (Zapier can't create Zaps via public API; Power Automate can't create end-user "My flows" cleanly via API) are called out where they matter and expanded in the references.

## 1. Should you automate at all?

Most "we should automate this" instincts are wrong — not because automation is bad, but because the process underneath isn't ready, or the payoff isn't there. Gate on four factors, all of them, before writing a line:

- **Frequency** — how many times per week/month does this run? A once-a-quarter task rarely earns its maintenance cost.
- **Time saved per run** — minutes of human toil removed each time. Two minutes × 1,000 runs beats an hour × 3.
- **Error rate of doing it by hand** — high manual error rate (typos, missed steps, missed SLAs) is often a bigger win than the time saved. Automation's real product is *consistency*, not just speed.
- **Stability of the process** — how often do the steps, the systems, or the rules change? An unstable process is the one thing that turns automation into a liability.

Rough gate: automate when it is **frequent AND stable AND** either saves meaningful time-per-run *or* removes a costly manual error rate. If it's frequent but unstable, or high-value but requires judgment on every run, do not automate yet — see below. Full scoring rubric with worked numbers: `references/automate-decision-and-roi.md`.

### The trap: automating a broken or unstable process

Automating a bad process just makes you produce bad output faster, and now nobody can see the badness because a machine hides it. **Fix and standardize the process first, then automate the standardized version.** If the steps aren't written down the same way twice, if it "depends", if three people do it three ways — you are not ready. Standardize on paper, run it manually a few times against the written steps, *then* encode it. Automating chaos gives you automated chaos with a maintenance bill.

### Human-in-the-loop: what you deliberately do NOT fully automate

Some steps should stay manual by design, wrapped in an approval gate rather than removed:

- **Judgment calls** — pricing exceptions, hiring decisions, content that carries brand/legal risk, anything where "usually right" isn't good enough.
- **Irreversible or high-blast-radius actions** — sending money, deleting data, emailing your whole list, publishing publicly, terminating accounts. Automate the *preparation*, require a human click for the *commit*.
- **Low-frequency, high-stakes** — the payoff is small and the cost of a silent wrong run is huge.

The pattern is *assisted*, not autonomous: the automation gathers, drafts, and stages; a human approves the commit. Cheap insurance against the day the automation is confidently wrong at scale.

## 2. ROI and build-vs-buy

### Payback math

```text
build cost      = hours to build  × loaded hourly rate
monthly saving  = (runs/month × time saved per run × loaded rate)
                  − monthly platform/run cost
                  − monthly maintenance cost   ← the line people forget
payback (months)= build cost / monthly saving
```

Two rules of thumb: if **payback > ~12 months**, the process is probably too rare or too cheap to bother; if **maintenance eats > ~30–50% of the gross saving**, you've built a pet, not a tool. Maintenance is not optional — APIs change, auth expires, edge cases surface. Budget it explicitly or the ROI is fiction. Worked examples: `references/automate-decision-and-roi.md`.

### No/low-code platform vs custom code

| Choose a no/low-code platform when… | Choose custom code when… |
| --- | --- |
| Gluing 2–8 SaaS apps with pre-built connectors | Logic is genuinely complex, algorithmic, or stateful |
| Business owner needs to read/edit the flow | High volume where per-run platform billing dominates TCO |
| Speed to first version matters more than control | You need version control, tests, code review, CI on the logic |
| Volume is modest and connectors exist | The vendor has no connector and you need deep API control |

The honest middle: platforms win on **time-to-first-version and readability**; code wins on **complex logic, testability, and cost at scale**. Many mature setups are hybrid — a platform orchestrates and a small custom service (or `api-connector-builder` client) does the hard part.

### Total cost of ownership

TCO is not the sticker price. Count: the **platform bill under your real volume and its billing unit** (this is where surprises live — see §3), build time, ongoing maintenance, the cost of an outage when it fails silently, and the switching cost if you outgrow the platform. A "free" automation that a senior engineer babysits monthly is not free.

## 3. Platform selection

Pick on **billing unit first** — it's the axis that dictates cost at scale, and choosing on familiarity instead is the classic 10× mistake. Then filter on data residency, ecosystem, programmatic maturity, and portability. This is a routing decision: once chosen, hand off to that platform's skill.

| Axis | n8n | Make | Zapier | Power Automate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Billing unit** | per **execution** (whole run = 1, any # of steps); self-host = $0 | per **credit** (each module action = 1; was "operations", renamed 2025-08-27) | per **task** (every action counts) | per **user** or per **flow** (premium); bundled with many M365 plans |
| **Best cost shape** | few long/complex flows, high volume | moderate multi-step flows | many short simple flows | teams already paying for M365 |
| **Self-host / data residency** | **yes** — your infra, your data | no (EU/US regions only) | no | Microsoft cloud / Dataverse regions |
| **Ecosystem fit** | technical teams, raw HTTP, code nodes | mid-market, deep per-app modules | widest app catalog (~9,000+) | **native to Microsoft 365** — Teams, SharePoint, Outlook, Dataverse |
| **Programmatic + MCP maturity** | public REST API to CRUD workflows; community MCP; strongest for code-driven ops | management API + MCP support maturing | rich API for actions + Zapier MCP to expose actions to agents — **but no public API to create Zaps** | Flow management APIs + solutions/ARM — **but no clean public API to create end-user "My flows"** |
| **Portability** | high — export/import JSON + self-hostable runtime | medium — blueprint export/import, but runs only on Make | low — no portable export | low — tied to MS solutions |

**Routing shortcuts:** already living in Microsoft 365 → **Power Automate** (`../power-automate/SKILL.md`). Data must stay on your own infra, or high volume where execution-billing wins → **n8n** (`../n8n/SKILL.md`). Obscure app, non-technical owner → **Zapier** (`../zapier/SKILL.md`). Deep per-app modules, mid volume → **Make** (`../make/SKILL.md`).

**Two capability limits to state honestly, not paper over:** you can drive Zapier's actions programmatically and via MCP, but you **cannot create a Zap through a public API** — Zap authoring is UI-only. Power Automate exposes flow *management* and solution deployment, but there is **no clean public API to author an end-user's personal "My flows"**. If a plan depends on API-creating either, the plan is wrong. Full matrix, MCP notes, and caveats: `references/platform-selection-matrix.md`.

## 4. Orchestration strategy (engine-agnostic)

These are the guarantees every automation must meet regardless of platform. This is the *policy*; the per-platform *recipe* lives in `../automation-flows/SKILL.md` and the platform skills. Deep dive: `references/orchestration-and-antipatterns.md`.

- **Idempotency & dedup.** Delivery is at-least-once and retries replay; assume every event can arrive twice. Require a **stable dedup key** (event id / external id) checked *before* any non-idempotent write (charge, email, insert). No dedup on a non-idempotent write = duplicate charges waiting to happen.
- **Error paths, retries & backoff.** Every automation has a defined destination for failure. Retry **transient** errors (timeouts, 429/5xx) with backoff and a cap; do **not** retry **permanent** errors (400/validation) — route them out. A flow with no error path isn't finished.
- **Dead-letter.** After retries are exhausted, the failed item lands in a durable place a human can inspect and replay — a queue, a table, an "incomplete executions" store. Dropped-on-the-floor failures are invisible data loss.
- **Observability & alerting.** Emit success/failure counts; put a **heartbeat on scheduled jobs and alert on silence** (a cron that stops firing is the failure you never hear about). Route alerts to a named owner, not a dead inbox.
- **Secrets handling.** Credentials in the platform's credential store / a vault, referenced by name — never pasted inline where an export leaks them. Least privilege, and a rotation plan. Engineering detail → `../secure-coding/SKILL.md`.
- **Versioning & environments.** Separate **dev/staging from prod**; export before you edit; keep a rollback. Changes to a live automation are production changes and deserve the same care.
- **Avoid fan-out storms.** Cap concurrency, batch, and rate-limit. Watch for **echo loops** (flow A writes a record that triggers flow B that triggers flow A) and for a single event fanning out into thousands of downstream calls that trip rate limits or blow the bill.

## 5. Anti-patterns

| Anti-pattern | Why it bites | Do instead |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **No error path** | First API hiccup, the run dies; you learn from an angry customer | Define a failure destination + alert before shipping |
| **Silent failure** | Failures that don't alert erode trust worse than no automation — everyone assumes it worked | Alert on failure *and* on silence (heartbeat) |
| **No kill-switch** | When it misfires at scale, there's no fast way to stop the bleeding | Every outward-writing automation gets a documented pause/disable toggle |
| **Over-automation** | Automating rare / low-value / judgment work costs more to maintain than doing it by hand | Gate on §1; leave judgment steps human-in-the-loop |
| **Automating a broken process** | You produce bad output faster and hide the badness behind a machine | Standardize the process first, then encode it |
| **Hidden single point of failure** | One personal token / one undocumented flow everyone depends on | Service accounts, documented dependencies, no personal-account glue |
| **No owner** | Orphaned automations rot; nobody notices the break or knows how it works | Name an owner + a one-page runbook per automation |
| **Choosing platform by familiarity** | Bill 10× higher than the right billing unit; "our automation bill exploded" | Pick by billing unit for your run shape (§3) |

## Checklist

- [ ] Ran the §1 gate: frequency × time-saved × error-rate × **stability** — and confirmed the process is standardized, not chaos being paved.
- [ ] Identified any judgment / irreversible / high-blast-radius step and kept it human-in-the-loop with an approval gate.
- [ ] Computed payback including **maintenance**, and confirmed it's under the rule-of-thumb ceiling.
- [ ] Decided platform vs custom code on the build-vs-buy criteria, not on what's familiar.
- [ ] Chose the platform by **billing unit for the real run shape**, then data residency / ecosystem / portability — and did NOT assume a capability the platform lacks (Zap creation, PA "My flows").
- [ ] Specified the orchestration guarantees §4 requires (idempotency key, error path, dead-letter, heartbeat/alert, secrets store, dev/prod split, fan-out caps) as requirements handed to the build skill.
- [ ] Every automation has a named owner, a runbook, and a kill-switch.
- [ ] Routed the actual build to `automation-flows` / the chosen platform skill — no flow was built inside this skill.

# Review — adversarial code review, both directions

Review is the **penultimate gate** of the rsc SDD chain: `constitution → specify → clarify → plan → tasks → analyze → implement → verify → **review** → ship`. By the time a diff reaches review, the `verify` phase has already proven that lint, types, tests and the stack `verify.sh` are green. Review answers a different question: **is the green diff actually correct, well-scoped, and faithful to the spec — or did it pass for the wrong reasons?**

This skill owns **two roles that share one discipline**:

- **Giving** a review — read a diff adversarially, find the real defects, rank them by impact, ship the verdict as evidence not opinion.
- **Receiving** a review — take incoming feedback (human or machine), verify each point against the code *before* acting, fix the real findings, and push back — with proof — on the wrong ones.

The discipline is the same in both directions: **every finding and every rebuttal carries evidence — no agreement without verification, no objection without a defect.** A reviewer who waves through a bug to be agreeable, and an author who edits working code because a comment *sounded* authoritative, are making the same mistake. Everything below is in service of that one rule.

**Route out** when the ask isn't this gate: a deep OWASP / threat-model pass belongs to `../secure-coding/SKILL.md` (review folds its findings in, but the dedicated pass is owned there); a "is this idiomatic React/FastAPI/Go/SQL" question belongs to the stack skill (`../nextjs/SKILL.md`, `../fastapi/SKILL.md`, `../go/SKILL.md`, `../postgresdb/SKILL.md`, `../flutter/SKILL.md`) — pull the idiom there, then judge against it here.

## Read these first

1. `02-DOCS/wiki/sdd/specs/<slug>.md` and `02-DOCS/wiki/sdd/plans/<slug>.md` — what the diff was *supposed* to do. A review with no spec is a review of vibes.
2. `02-DOCS/wiki/sdd/constitution.md` — the project's non-negotiables (stack canon, quality bars, conventions). Constitution violations are findings even when the code "works".
3. `02-DOCS/wiki/harness/user-profile.md` — the accompaniment dial (see "Narration dial" below).

If there is no spec/plan (someone jumped straight to code), say so and review against the constitution + the diff's own stated intent. Don't pretend a spec exists.

## Confidence filtering

A review's value is its signal-to-noise. Every finding you report costs the author triage time, so report only what you can stand behind:

- **>80% sure, or it doesn't ship.** If you're not >80% confident a finding is a real defect, either trace it until you are, or downgrade it to `[question]` and ask. Plausible-looking ≠ verified.
- **Zero findings is an acceptable verdict.** A clean diff gets `APPROVE`, not a manufactured nit. Padding a report to look thorough is the opposite of thorough.
- **Common false positives to skip:** patterns guarded two functions up; "unsafe" calls on values that are provably constant/internal; missing checks the framework already enforces; style the linter owns; defects behind a flag that's off everywhere (note as `nit`, not blocker); test-only or generated code held to prod standards.
- **No severity inflation.** A `should-fix` dressed as a `blocker` burns the same trust as a missed bug. Rank by actual blast radius and reachability — if everything is a blocker, nothing is.

This skill is the discipline; the **`rsc-review` bundle is it executed** — `/code-review [pr]` fans a diff out to the per-language reviewer fleet and aggregates one ranked verdict, `/security-scan` merges automated scanners with the `security-reviewer` agent into an exploitability-ranked report. Both enforce the same evidence bar and confidence filtering described here.

## GIVING a review

A good review is not a list of everything you'd have done differently. It is a ranked set of **defects that matter**, each one reproducible from the diff itself.

### The pass order

Run these passes in order; each is cheap and catches a different class of defect. Stop padding the report once a pass is clean — a clean pass is a finding too ("auth path: checked ownership scoping, correct").

| Pass | The question | Typical defects |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1. Spec fidelity** | Does the diff do what the spec/plan said — no more, no less? | Missing acceptance criteria; scope creep; a TODO masquerading as done |
| **2. Correctness** | Is it right on the boundaries, not just the happy path? | Off-by-one, null/empty/zero, error paths swallowed, race, wrong operator |
| **3. Contracts & data** | Do the interfaces and data shapes hold? | Breaking API change, nullable mismatch, migration that loses data, N+1 |
| **4. Security boundary** | Any untrusted input reaching a sink? | Injection, authz gap (authenticated ≠ authorized), secret in diff, SSRF |
| **5. Tests as evidence** | Do the tests actually exercise the change, or just pass? | Asserts on mocks, no failing case, happy-path-only, deleted assertions |
| **6. Constitution & fit** | Does it honor the project's canon and read like the codebase? | Banned pattern, wrong layer, duplicated logic, dead code left behind |

Passes 1–5 are correctness/safety — those produce **blocking** findings. Pass 6 is fit — usually **non-blocking** unless it violates a stated constitution rule.

### Severity — rank or it's noise

Tag every finding. An unranked review forces the author to triage your opinions; a ranked one tells them exactly what blocks the merge.

- **`blocker`** — ships a bug, a vuln, data loss, or breaks the spec. Merge does not happen until resolved.
- **`should-fix`** — real defect, narrow blast radius; fix now or file a tracked follow-up the author agrees to.
- **`nit`** — style/preference with no correctness impact. Explicitly labelled, never blocking, the author may decline freely.

If everything is a blocker, nothing is. If everything is a nit, you didn't review.

### Finding format

Each finding is a quoted location, the defect, the evidence, and a concrete fix. No "consider maybe looking at error handling here."

```text
[blocker] auth: authenticated user can read any document
  where:  api/documents.py:42  return db.get(Document, doc_id)
  why:    doc_id comes from the path; no owner check. Any logged-in
          user enumerates every document by id.
  repro:  GET /documents/<other_users_id> with a valid session → 200 + body.
  fix:    scope the query — WHERE id == doc_id AND owner_id == current_user.id;
          return 404 (not 403) on miss to avoid leaking existence.
```

A finding without a `repro` or a mechanism is a *suspicion*. Label it `[question]` and ask, don't assert it as a defect.

### Verify before you flag

The reviewer is held to the same evidence bar as the author, because a reviewer who cries blocker on a non-bug burns the same trust as an author who ships one. Before writing a `blocker`:

- **Read the surrounding code**, not just the diff hunk. The check you think is missing may live two functions up.
- **Trace the value**, don't pattern-match. "This looks like SQL injection" is not a finding; "this f-string interpolates `request.args['q']` straight into `execute()`" is.
- **Confirm the path is reachable.** A defect behind a flag that's off in every environment is a `nit`, not a `blocker` — say so.

### The verdict

End every review you give with one of three, and nothing mushy in between:

- **`APPROVE`** — no blockers, no unresolved should-fix. Say it plainly and **point to ship**.
- **`APPROVE WITH NITS`** — mergeable; the nits are the author's call.
- **`CHANGES REQUESTED`** — one or more blockers/should-fix. List exactly what unblocks it.

### The sello — when this project opted in

If the sello is on — `.rsc/sello-config.json` in the project, or `~/.rsc/sello-config.json` for
every project (`sello on --global`; the project switch always wins) — the review's verdict is
**sealed to the exact bytes reviewed**, and the ship gate refuses commit/push/PR on anything else.

**What the sello does and does not prove.** It binds bytes, not intent: it guarantees *what ships
is what was reviewed*, never *the review was good*. You are the one calling `sello approve`, so it
is self-attested — drift protection between review and delivery, not tamper-evidence. Sealing
without actually running the lenses produces a valid sello and a worthless one.

Every state transition is deterministic CLI, never tokens:

```text
1. npx @ericrisco/rsc sello freeze      → hashes the candidate, prints risk tier + lens count
2. Run the lenses (below), filter findings, decide
3a. approved → npx @ericrisco/rsc sello approve --lenses correctness,security,tests
3b. blocked  → npx @ericrisco/rsc sello block --reason "<the blocking finding>"
```

`approve` refuses to seal with fewer lenses than the tier requires — pass them all, or accept the
gap deliberately with `--accept-partial-lenses` (it is recorded). Every approval also appends to
`.rsc/sello-log.jsonl`, so what shipped under which verdict survives the next freeze.

**Lenses by risk tier** — tier 0 never reaches you (the gate passes docs/copy silently);
tier 1 → run the single most relevant pass from the table above yourself; tier 2 → dispatch
**three parallel fresh-context subagents** (correctness · security · tests-as-evidence), each told
to *refute* readiness, not confirm it. Fresh context is the point: a reviewer who inherits the
implementer's context inherits its blind spots.

**Give each refuter exactly four inputs — no more, no less.** The diff alone is not enough, and
that is not a detail: with only the diff, the one failure class no test suite can structurally
catch — *the change is correct and is not what the approved spec asked for* — is invisible to the
whole panel.

1. **The task contract** — the original request **plus every scope change a human explicitly
   approved since.** Not just the first message: without the approved changes a legitimate scope
   revision reads as a spec gap and you get a confident false positive.
2. **The approved spec** (`02-DOCS/wiki/sdd/specs/<slug>.md`).
3. **The exact source state** — commit SHA, or a tree hash when git is absent. A verdict belongs to
   the state that was reviewed, not to the project.
4. **The entry point** — the one command that reruns the checks.

**And say what they do not get:** your conversation, your reasoning, your defences, and your draft
verdict. If a claim needs your justification to stand, it is not proven.

**Blind first, compare second.** Each refuter records what it attacked and what it found *before*
being shown your conclusions. Only then may it compare and add findings — the blind record is
append-only after that, never rewritten. Skip this and the fresh context is spent confirming your
framing, which is the one thing it was bought to avoid.

**The attack list is the deliverable, not just the findings.** "Nothing found" without saying where
you looked is indistinguishable from not having looked — the same rule that governs a dismissal.

Two extra finding classes the four inputs unlock, neither reachable from a diff:

- **Contract vs spec** — what would a caller reasonably expect, given the stated deployment, that
  no clause covers? An exclusion the spec deliberately approved is **not** a finding; an exclusion
  the spec describes *inaccurately* is.
- **Mapping, both directions** — an acceptance criterion with no test that can be made to fail, and
  a test pinning behaviour no criterion asked for.

**A finding blocks only if it survives all three filters** — no exceptions, and eagerness to
find something is not evidence:

1. **Causal** — introduced by *this* change. Pre-existing defects → note with
   `--note "<finding>"` (they land in `.rsc/sello-findings.md`, surfaced by `doctor`) and
   suggest an issue; they never block this delivery.
2. **Severity** — only `blocker` blocks. `should-fix`/`nit` → `--note`.
3. **Evidence** — a `repro` or a concrete failure scenario. A suspicion without one is a
   `[question]`, and questions don't block.

**Fixing a blocker is budgeted, one attempt.** Before touching anything: estimate the fix and
declare it — `npx @ericrisco/rsc sello budget --lines <N>`. After the fix:
`sello budget-check` (over budget → justify with `--justify "…"` or shrink; an unexplained
overrun is how over-engineering enters disguised as a fix). Then `sello freeze` + re-review
**only the divergence**, and approve. Still broken after one attempt → stop, hand it to the human.

## RECEIVING a review

This is the half everyone skips. Feedback arrives and the reflex is to either comply with all of it (looks cooperative, ships bugs) or dismiss the annoying parts (looks confident, ships bugs). Both skip the only step that matters: **checking whether the finding is true.**

### Process every comment through this gate

For each incoming finding, before touching a line of code:

```text
1. RESTATE   — what is the reviewer actually claiming is wrong? (in one sentence)
2. VERIFY    — go to the code. Is the claim true? Trace it. Can you reproduce it?
3. CLASSIFY  — true defect / partially-true / false / unclear
4. ACT       —
     true        → fix it, and add the test that would have caught it
     partial     → fix the real part, reply on the rest with evidence
     false       → DON'T change the code. Reply with the proof it's already handled
     unclear     → ask one specific question; don't guess and don't pre-emptively edit
```

The expensive failure is step 2 skipped. Editing working code because a comment *sounded* right introduces bugs the original author (you) already prevented.

### Pushback is a feature, not rudeness

Disagreeing with a wrong finding — **with evidence** — is doing the job, not being difficult. The reply is not "you're wrong"; it's the trace:

```text
> Reviewer: this can NPE if `user` is null.
Verified: `user` is non-null here — it's the return of `require_auth()` on
line 12, which raises 401 before this line on a null session. Added a test
(test_get_doc_unauthenticated) that asserts the 401 so this stays true.
Leaving the code as-is.
```

That reply *strengthens* the diff (it added a regression test) while declining the change. That's the bar.

### Performative agreement is the failure mode

The tells, and what to do instead:

| Tell | Reality | Do instead |
| --- | --- | --- |
| "Good catch!" then editing without checking | You don't yet know if it's a catch | Verify first; *then* "good catch" or "checked — already handled" |
| Rewriting a whole function to satisfy a nit | Scope creep dressed as responsiveness | Make the minimal change the nit asks for, or decline it as a nit |
| Silently making the change the bot suggested | Bots flag plausible-looking non-bugs constantly | Trace it like any other finding; reply with the verdict |
| "You're probably right" with no trace | Probably-right is not verified | There is no probably. Reproduce it or refute it |

### Author's verdict

When you've processed the review, summarize for the reviewer (and the decisions log): findings accepted + fixed (with the commit/test), findings declined + why (with evidence), findings deferred + tracked. Then the diff is ready to re-review or, if clean, to ship.

## Anti-patterns → STOP

| Rationalization | Reality |
| --- | --- |
| "It passed verify, so it's correct" | Green gates prove it runs and tests pass, not that the logic is right. Review is the logic gate. |
| "I'll list everything I'd do differently" | A review is ranked defects, not your preferences. Tag nits as nits or drop them. |
| "This pattern usually means a bug" | Usually isn't a finding. Trace this instance or label it `[question]`. |
| "The reviewer is senior, they're probably right" | Seniority isn't evidence. Verify the claim against the code like any other. |
| "Just apply all the comments, it's faster" | Applying a false finding ships a regression. Each comment goes through the gate. |
| "Pushing back will look defensive" | Pushing back *with a trace* strengthens the diff. Silent compliance hides bugs. |
| "I'll approve it, the issues are minor" | If they're truly minor, label them nits and approve. If they block, don't approve. No mushy middle. |
| "No spec, so I'll just eyeball it" | Say there's no spec and review against the constitution + stated intent. Don't fake a baseline. |

## Narration dial

Read the level from `02-DOCS/wiki/harness/user-profile.md`. It changes what a review *shows*, never its rigor — every level runs the same passes and the same evidence bar. No profile → default L2 and proceed; don't stall a review to ask for a dial setting.

- **L0** — verdict + the blocker list, terse. `CHANGES REQUESTED: 1 blocker (auth, documents.py:42), 1 nit. Fix the auth scope and re-run verify.`
- **L1** — each finding gets its one-line *why*.
- **L2** — full finding format (where/why/repro/fix); explain why each blocker blocks.
- **L3** — the above plus teaching: name the defect class (IDOR, N+1, TOCTOU), why the boundary matters, and how to not reintroduce it. For non-technical authors, translate the impact ("any logged-in person could read everyone else's documents").

## Model tier — `heavy` (opt-in routing)

This phase's default model tier is **`heavy`** — adversarial diff reading is where the strongest model pays off most. Routing is **off** unless `models.enabled: true` in `02-DOCS/wiki/sdd/config.yaml`. When on: resolve this phase's tier (`models.overrides` wins over `models.phases`), map it to a model via `models.tiers`, and apply per `../sdd/references/model-routing.md` — announce the switch per the narration dial when it differs from the session model, and dispatch any `Task`/`parallel` subagents on that model. Routing off or no profile → honor the session model silently. Never fake a switch a tool can't make; skip routing on a one-line change.

## Where this writes

Review is mostly a conversation, but two artifacts persist into the harness wiki so the knowledge model grows:

- **Accepted/declined findings** of consequence → append to `02-DOCS/wiki/sdd/decisions.md` (e.g. "declined NPE finding on documents.py:42 — guarded by require_auth; added regression test"). This is the same append-only log `implement` writes to.
- If a finding reveals a **missing constitution rule** (a defect class the project keeps hitting), propose adding it to `02-DOCS/wiki/sdd/constitution.md` so the next review catches it earlier.

Index both in `02-DOCS/wiki/index.md` (the Knowledge map; root `CLAUDE.md` keeps only a short pointer) under the `sdd/` topic — the harness owns that map; this skill just keeps its rows honest.

## Result envelope

End with the parseable block every SDD phase shares, so the dispatcher can chain without
interpreting prose (contract: `../sdd/SKILL.md`):

```json result-envelope
{
  "status": "complete|blocked|failed",
  "executive_summary": "Adversarial review against spec/plan/constitution; verdict and blocking findings.",
  "artifact": "02-DOCS/wiki/sdd/reviews/<slug>.md",
  "next_recommended": "ship",
  "risk": "low|medium|high",
  "skill_resolution": {
    "used": ["review"],
    "missing": [],
    "fallback": [],
    "compact_rules": ["Rank or it is noise: blocker / should-fix / nit.", "A finding without a repro is a question, not a defect."]
  },
  "evidence": ["verdict stated (APPROVE | APPROVE WITH NITS | CHANGES REQUESTED)", "each blocker carries location + repro + fix"]
}
```

## Next in the chain

When the diff carries an **APPROVE** / **APPROVE WITH NITS** verdict and every blocker is resolved, hand off to **ship** — close the branch via PR / merge / cleanup, with **git authorship as Eric, never Claude**. If the review came back **CHANGES REQUESTED**, the loop goes back to **implement** (fix), then **verify** (re-prove green), then back here for re-review. Don't ship a diff that hasn't earned its verdict.

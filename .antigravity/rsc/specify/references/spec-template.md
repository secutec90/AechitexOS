# Spec template

Copy this into `02-DOCS/wiki/sdd/specs/<slug>.md`, fill it, and delete the
italic guidance lines. Every line stays on WHAT and WHY — no framework, table,
endpoint, library, file path, or algorithm. If you can't phrase it without
naming the tech, it's a *point to clarify*, not a requirement.

# Spec — <Feature name>

> Slug: `<slug>` · Status: draft · Created: <YYYY-MM-DD>
> Inherits: [constitution](../constitution.md)

## Problem & why
<The pain, who feels it, and the cost of leaving it unsolved. One short
paragraph. State the problem, not a pre-chosen solution.>

## Cost of not building it
<What concretely happens if nobody does this, and what it costs. If the honest
answer is "not much", that IS the finding — write it down rather than softening
it. Required for specs dated 2026-09-06 or later.>

## The cheapest alternative
<What would solve most of this WITHOUT building it, and why that is not enough.
"Nothing" is not an answer; there is always a manual workaround, a smaller
version, or doing nothing. Required for specs dated 2026-09-06 or later.>

## Goals
- <What success delivers, in outcome terms. One bullet per goal.>

## Non-goals / out of scope
- <What is explicitly NOT done in THIS change — adjacent features, deferred
  work, things a reader might assume are included. Be explicit, not silent:
  unsaid scope becomes assumed scope.>

## Users & context
<Who acts, the situation they're in, and what they're trying to achieve.
Real users from the constitution/wiki, not invented personas.>

## Behaviour
- Main path: <what the system does, observably, in the common case>
- Edge cases: <empty, maximum, boundary, concurrent, repeated…>
- Error paths: <what the user sees when it goes wrong; what is NOT revealed>

## Acceptance criteria
<Binary, observable checks. Prefer Given / When / Then. Each must be later
checkable by `verify` and convertible to a `tasks` done-check.>
- Given <state>, When <action>, Then <observable outcome>.
- Given <state>, When <action>, Then <observable outcome>.

## Points to clarify
<The typed handoff to `clarify`. Every entry declares which of the four it is,
because each one gets a different action from the next phase. Non-empty is
normal; untyped is not — an untyped entry is read as `pregunta abierta`, the
costliest of the four.>
- **pregunta abierta** — <formulable now, unanswered. clarify asks it.>
- **suposición tomada** — <what you decided.> *Base:* <why.> *Riesgo:* <what
  changes if it turns out wrong.> clarify validates it rather than re-asking.
- **decisión diferida** — <sharp, out of this cycle on purpose. clarify leaves
  it.>
- **área no formulable** — <you can tell something is coming and cannot phrase
  the question yet. clarify notes it; it graduates when it sharpens.>
```

## Field notes

- **Status** moves `draft` → `clarified` (after the `clarify` phase) → `planned`
  (once `plan` exists). Don't invent other states. An approval obtained as a
  blanket "just run it" is recorded as **approved in autopilot**, not flat.
- **Before you call it written**, run `npm run spec:gate <path>`. It checks that
  every section here carries content or an explicit open point, and prints the
  clauses it cannot check (the unmarked assumption is yours).
- **The two doubt sections are dated, not retroactive.** `Cost of not building
  it` and `The cheapest alternative` are required only for specs whose
  frontmatter `timestamp` is `2026-09-06` or later. Specs written before that
  are exempt — they cannot answer honestly after the fact, and a gate that turns
  the whole corpus red is a gate that gets switched off. A spec with no readable
  `timestamp` falls on the exempt side too.
- **Sharpness, not difficulty**, sorts the last two types from the first: *can
  you state the question precisely now?* Not *can you answer it?* Anything past
  what this change is for goes to **Non-goals**, where it never graduates.
- **Behaviour** is where HOW leaks in most. Audit every verb: "queries",
  "caches", "calls", "stores in" are implementation. Replace with the observable
  effect ("shows", "lets the user", "prevents", "remembers across visits").
- **Acceptance criteria** are the contract `verify` checks at the end of the
  chain. A criterion a human has to subjectively judge is not done — sharpen it
  or move the soft part to *Points to clarify*.
- **Updating an existing spec** (same slug): read it, merge new understanding,
  keep the history of resolved clarifications visible rather than silently
  rewriting. Never overwrite blind.

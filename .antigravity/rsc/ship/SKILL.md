# Ship — close the development branch

Ship is the **last gate** of the rsc SDD chain: `constitution → specify → clarify → plan → tasks → analyze → implement → verify → review → **ship**`. Everything upstream proved the work is *correct* and *green*; ship is the act of **landing it** — turning an approved branch into merged history, a pull request, or a clean parked branch — without breaking the trunk and without ever forging the author.

This skill owns one decision and its safe execution: **how does this work integrate?** It does not write code, run test gates, or read the diff for defects — those phases already happened. It is the **close, not the open**: creating the isolated branch or worktree is `../worktrees/SKILL.md`, taking the gates green is `../verify/SKILL.md`, reading the diff adversarially is `../review/SKILL.md`, and putting merged code onto a server is `../deployment/SKILL.md`.

## The hard rule: git authorship is Eric, never Claude

> **Every commit and every PR ships under Eric's name. No `Co-Authored-By: Claude`. No `Co-Authored-By` for any AI. No "🤖 Generated with Claude Code" footer. No "made by an agent" line in the PR body. Nothing that attributes the work to a tool.**

This is absolute — not a preference to weigh against convenience — because a commit is a permanent, published claim about who wrote something. The work is Eric's; the agent is a tool he used, like an editor or a compiler, and you do not credit the compiler in the commit message. Once a forged trailer is pushed it is in everyone's history and only a rewrite removes it.

Concretely, before any commit or PR:

- **Never** pass `--author` to set a non-Eric author. The repo's configured `user.name` / `user.email` (Eric's) is the author and committer.
- If `git config user.email` is unset or clearly not Eric's, **stop and ask** which identity to commit under — do not guess, and do not substitute an agent identity.
- If you find a Claude/AI trailer in a commit you are about to push (e.g. left over from an upstream tool), **strip it** before the branch lands.

Verify it after writing the commit. A non-empty match is a blocker: amend and re-check before the branch goes anywhere.

```bash
git log -1 --format='%an <%ae>%n%n%b' | grep -iE 'co-authored-by.*(claude|anthropic|ai)|generated with|claude code' \
  && echo "AUTHORSHIP VIOLATION — strip the trailer before shipping" \
  || echo "authorship clean"
```

## Read these first

1. `02-DOCS/wiki/harness/user-profile.md` — the accompaniment dial (L0..L3). It sets narration only, never whether you run the safety checklist.
2. The **review verdict** for this branch — ship runs only on `APPROVE` or `APPROVE WITH NITS`. `CHANGES REQUESTED` loops back to `implement`, not forward to ship. If there is no verdict on record, say so and treat it as a red flag: do not ship a diff that skipped `../review/SKILL.md` — offer to run it first.
3. `02-DOCS/wiki/sdd/decisions.md` and the spec/plan slug — so the commit message and PR body describe *what shipped against which spec*, not a vague "various changes".

## The pre-ship safety checklist

Run this before presenting the landing options. Any unchecked item is a stop — surface it, don't ship around it.

- [ ] **Review verdict is APPROVE / APPROVE WITH NITS** (not CHANGES REQUESTED, not absent).
- [ ] **Working tree is clean** — `git status --short` is empty. No stray edits sneaking into the merge.
- [ ] **On a feature branch, not the trunk** — `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` is not `main`/`master`. If work landed directly on the trunk, that is its own problem; flag it, don't paper over it.
- [ ] **Rebased / up to date with the base** — branch is on top of latest `main`; conflicts resolved locally, not punted to the merge.
- [ ] **No secrets in the diff** — scan the staged/branch diff for keys, tokens, `.env` values (`git diff main... | grep -iE 'api[_-]?key|secret|password|token|BEGIN .*PRIVATE KEY'`). A hit is a blocker; remove it, and rotate it if it was ever pushed.
- [ ] **Authorship is Eric** — `git config user.email` is Eric's; no AI trailer in any commit on the branch (run the grep above across `main..HEAD`).
- [ ] **Commit history is intelligible** — squashed or organized so the history reads as deliberate, not "wip wip fix fix".

```bash
# one-shot pre-ship snapshot (read-only)
echo "branch:   $(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)"
echo "clean?:   $([ -z "$(git status --short)" ] && echo yes || echo NO-dirty)"
echo "behind:   $(git rev-list --count HEAD..origin/main 2>/dev/null || echo '?') commits behind origin/main"
git log main..HEAD --format='%an <%ae>' | sort -u   # authors on this branch — expect only Eric
git diff main...HEAD | grep -icE 'api[_-]?key|secret|password|token|BEGIN .*PRIVATE KEY' \
  | sed 's/^/secret-hits: /'
```

### Automated guard (PreToolUse) — you cannot quietly abandon a feature

When rsc is installed for Claude Code, a `PreToolUse` hook (`.rsc/ship-guard.mjs`) enforces this
phase at the one deterministic moment it matters: it **denies** any Bash command that switches to
`main`/`master` or merges while the current feature branch has **uncommitted changes** or **commits
that were never pushed**. The denial reason names the branch and routes you here. The guard is
local-only (no network), **fail-open** (any ambiguity — detached HEAD, no repo, git error — allows
the command), and can be disabled per project with `.rsc/.no-ship-guard`. It guarantees the
commit → push step; opening the PR is still this skill's job (and its hard rule). If the guard
blocks you, do not work around it — run ship.

The same guard also enforces the **sello** where it was opted into — per project
(`.rsc/sello-config.json`) or for all of them (`~/.rsc/sello-config.json` via
`sello on --global`, with the project switch always winning; `rsc sello status` prints which
scope decided): commit, push and PR are denied unless the change's exact bytes match the
sealed, approved review — one byte of drift, a moved base, or a missing review on a risk>0 change
all block, and every denial names its way out (re-run `review`, or `npx @ericrisco/rsc sello off`).
Risk-0 changes (docs/copy) always pass silently. Off by default; the flow lives in the `review`
skill. Note `.rsc/.no-ship-guard` opts out of the branch-hygiene rules above but **not** of the
sello, which has its own switch. The sello binds bytes, not intent — it proves what ships is what
was reviewed, never that the review was any good.

## The three landing options — always present exactly three

This mirrors the harness "siempre 3 opciones" pattern. Gather the one fact that changes the answer (does this repo use PRs / require review on `main`?), then present **exactly three** with an honest recommendation matched to the workflow and the accompaniment level.

| Option | What it does | Choose it when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1. Direct merge to trunk** | Fast-forward or `--no-ff` merge into `main`, push, delete the branch | Solo repo or trusted-trunk workflow; `main` is not protected; you are the only reviewer and review already passed |
| **2. Pull request** | Push the branch, open a PR with a spec-linked body, let CI / a human gate the merge | `main` is protected; a team or CI must sign off; you want the change reviewable in the forge even if you self-merge |
| **3. Park or discard** | Keep the branch un-merged (park) or delete it (discard) | The approach was superseded, the spike answered its question, or the work is paused — it should not land |

Recommend based on repo signals: protected `main` or an existing PR culture (look for `.github/`, prior PRs via `gh pr list`) → recommend **option 2**. A solo project with no protection and a passed review → **option 1** is honest and faster. Never default to a PR ceremony the repo doesn't use, and never force-merge a repo that gates `main`.

### Delivery strategy from SDD config

Read `02-DOCS/wiki/sdd/config.yaml` and the `Review Workload Forecast` in the plan if present.

- `single-pr` keeps option 2 as one PR.
- `ask-on-risk` pauses when the forecast exceeds the review budget and asks before landing a large diff.
- `autochain` uses stacked PRs when tasks are reviewable in dependency order.
- `exception` permits a larger single PR only when the user explicitly accepts the review risk.

Stacked PR / feature-track support still fits inside the three landing options: it is a shape of **option 2**, not a fourth option. Use a feature-track branch when several stacked PRs should integrate together before trunk.

## Executing each option

**Nothing below runs before the user picks an option.** Merging, pushing, opening a PR and deleting a branch are outward or irreversible — they change shared history or publish to a forge, and no later phase undoes them. A recommendation is not a yes; wait for one.

### Option 1 — direct merge

```bash
git switch main && git pull --ff-only
git merge --no-ff feature/<slug> -m "feat: <what shipped> (<spec-slug>)"   # no AI trailer
git push origin main
# the merge above already retired the worktree and its branch: post-merge does it
git branch -d feature/<slug> 2>/dev/null || true   # no worktree involved? then the branch alone
git push origin --delete feature/<slug> 2>/dev/null || true
```

Use `--no-ff` so the feature is one legible merge commit tied to the spec. Confirm the trunk still builds after the merge if the repo has a local gate (defer the actual run to `verify`).

**You no longer run the cleanup; you check that it ran.** A `post-merge` hook retires the worktree and its branch the moment the work lands, on both landing paths — the local merge above and the `pull --ff-only` after a forge merge. It removes only what the reaper already classifies as safe, so anything holding unsaved work survives with its reason, exactly as before.

This used to be an instruction in this paragraph, and it was skipped on both features that reached it. That is why it is a hook now: an instruction at the end of a long phase is the least reliable place to put a step that matters (P1).

If something did survive, it survived *for a reason* — read it rather than forcing it: `npx @ericrisco/rsc worktrees` lists what is left and why. `worktrees reap <path>` still exists for the backlog and for anything the hook deliberately refused; name the path, because bare `reap` retires every worktree that qualifies and with `parallel` running two streams that is how shipping A deletes B. Naming a path selects it, it does not accept the risk: add `--confirm` only after the user has seen the reason and said yes.

### Option 2 — pull request

Write the **commit(s)** clean, push, then open the PR with `gh`. The PR body links the spec/plan and lists what shipped — **and carries no AI attribution.**

```bash
git push -u origin feature/<slug>
gh pr create \
  --title "feat: <what shipped> (<spec-slug>)" \
  --body-file /tmp/ship-pr-body.md          # body authored per the template below — NO AI footer
```

PR body shape (no generated-with line, ever):

```markdown
## What

<one-paragraph summary of the change, in plain terms>

## Why

Implements `02-DOCS/wiki/sdd/specs/<slug>.md`. <the user-facing reason>

## How

- <key implementation point>
- <key implementation point>

## Verification

- `verify` phase: lint / types / tests green (see the verification record).
- Acceptance criteria from the spec: all met.
- Review verdict: APPROVE.
```

Then either let the gate run (team/CI) or self-merge once green: `gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch` (or `--merge` to preserve the history). Squash when the branch history is noisy; preserve when each commit is meaningful.

Once it is merged, pull the trunk — `git switch main && git pull --ff-only` — and the cleanup rides along with that pull: `post-merge` fires on a fast-forward too, verified. A squashed pull request is exactly the case the reaper judges by content rather than by commit identity, so it is recognised as landed; the local branch is kept, because git will not delete a squashed branch safely and while it exists the work is recoverable.

For stacked PRs, create each PR against the previous branch or against a feature-track branch, with bodies that name their dependency:

```markdown
Depends on: <previous PR or feature-track branch>
Part of: <spec-slug>
```

Never stack to hide review risk. Stack because each slice is independently reviewable and follows the task dependency order.

### Option 3 — park or discard

- **Park:** leave the branch, push it so it's not lost (`git push -u origin feature/<slug>`), and log *why it's parked* to `02-DOCS/wiki/sdd/decisions.md`. Do not merge.
- **Discard:** deletion is **destructive and unrecoverable** once the branch is gone from both sides, so it takes an explicit confirmation that quotes the branch name (the literal `yes, delete feature/<slug>`) before `git branch -D`. Anything ambiguous means keep it. Log the discard and the reason so the dead-end is remembered, not re-attempted.

**Park and discard do NOT reap.** The cleanup default acts only on work that is already in the trunk;
a parked branch is the opposite of that, and `worktrees reap` refuses it by design. Leave the worktree
where it is — the next `ship` that lands the branch will retire it. Discarding a worktree along with
unmerged work stays what it always was: explicit, confirmed with the quoted branch name, and logged.

If a native `EnterWorktree`-style tool created the workspace, exit through that tool rather than the
reaper — it owns its own lifecycle and its tracking has to stay consistent.

## Commit message discipline

The commit is the durable record. Make it describe the change and tie it to the spec — and keep it Eric's.

- **Subject:** `<gitmoji> type: imperative summary (<spec-slug>)` — `✨ feat:`, `🐛 fix:`, `♻️ refactor:`, etc. Under ~72 chars. The gitmoji is **not optional**: on Claude Code a PreToolUse guard denies a `git commit -m` without one, and the refusal hands back the corrected message. Emoji → intention table: `../git-workflow/references/gitmoji.md`.
- **Body:** *why*, not a restatement of the diff. Reference the spec slug and any decision logged in `decisions.md`.
- **Footer:** issue/PR refs only. **No `Co-Authored-By` for any AI. No "generated with" line.** This is where the violation usually sneaks in — leave the footer clean.

## Model tier — `light` (opt-in routing)

Closing the branch (PR / merge / cleanup) is mechanical, so this phase's default tier is **`light`**. Routing is **off** unless `models.enabled: true` in `02-DOCS/wiki/sdd/config.yaml`; when it is on, follow `../sdd/references/model-routing.md` for resolving and announcing the switch rather than from memory. Routing off or no profile → honor the session model silently, and skip routing on a one-line change. The Eric-only authorship rule is independent of the model and never relaxes.

## Accompaniment dial (L0..L3)

Read the level from `02-DOCS/wiki/harness/user-profile.md`. It changes what you show, **never** the safety checklist or the authorship rule. No profile → default to L2 and proceed; don't stall the ship to ask for a dial setting.

| Level | What ship shows |
| --- | --- |
| **L0** | Checklist run silently, recommended option in one line, execute on a yes: `Clean, rebased, authorship Eric. Recommend PR (main is protected). Open it?` |
| **L1** | The three options as one-liners, with the recommendation and its *why*. |
| **L2** | The full options table, the checklist results, and why the recommended option fits this repo's workflow. |
| **L3** | L2 plus teaching, framed for a non-technical owner: what fast-forward vs `--no-ff` does to history, why a protected `main` wants a PR ("asking permission before changing the shared copy"), what squashing trades away. |

## Anti-patterns → STOP

| Rationalization | Reality |
| --- | --- |
| "I'll add `Co-Authored-By: Claude` / a 'Generated with Claude Code' footer to be transparent" | It forges the record. The work is Eric's — no AI trailer, ever. Strip it. |
| "Review didn't formally approve but it's obviously fine" | No verdict = not ready. Ship runs on APPROVE only. Route back to review. |
| "The tree has a couple of stray edits, they're harmless" | A dirty tree means the merge is not the reviewed diff. Clean it or stash it first. |
| "`main` is protected but I'll just force-merge, I'm sure" | Protected means PR. Don't bypass the gate the repo deliberately set. |
| "I'll rebase and resolve conflicts during the merge" | Resolve before. A conflicted merge commit hides what actually shipped. |
| "The gitmoji is decoration, the conventional type is what matters" | Both ship or neither does. The type is for tooling, the emoji for the human scanning `git log` — and the guard denies the commit either way. |
| "This branch is dead, I'll just delete it" | Discard is destructive — confirm with the quoted branch name and log why first. |
| "Squash everything, history doesn't matter" | Squash noise, preserve meaning. The history is the next reader's spec. |
| "There's a key in the diff but it's a test key" | A secret in the diff is a blocker regardless. Pull it out before landing. |

## Where this writes

Ship is mostly git actions, but the outcome is recorded so the knowledge model stays whole:

- **The landing decision** (which of the three options, and why) → append to `02-DOCS/wiki/sdd/decisions.md`, the same append-only log `implement`, `verify`, and `review` write to. Parks and discards are logged with their reason so dead-ends aren't re-walked.
- A **shipped feature** flips its spec under `02-DOCS/wiki/sdd/specs/<slug>.md` to a shipped state (note the merge commit / PR). The harness owns the wiki; ship just keeps the `sdd/` rows in `02-DOCS/wiki/index.md` (the Knowledge map; root `CLAUDE.md` keeps only a short pointer) honest.
- An **archive bundle** closes the loop under `02-DOCS/wiki/sdd/archive/<slug>/`:
  - `final-report.md` — what shipped, why, landing decision, links.
  - `apply-progress.md` — copy or link to `progress/<slug>.md`.
  - `verification.md` — copy or link to the verification record.
  - `review.md` — review verdict and nits.
  - `state.yaml` — `shipped`, `parked` or `discarded`, PR/merge refs, date.

Archive after option 1/2 lands, and also after option 3 parks/discards so paused or abandoned work is remembered.

## Next in the chain

Ship is the end of the SDD loop for a feature. Two onward paths: the merged code still has to reach a **server / release** → hand off to **deployment** (`../deployment/SKILL.md`); or the next feature restarts the loop at **specify** (`../specify/SKILL.md`), or at **constitution** if the project's principles changed. The `sdd` dispatcher (`../sdd/SKILL.md`) routes whichever comes next.
